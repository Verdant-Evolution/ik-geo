For these setups, the forward_kinematics function was not public, so for the start, I was just testing whether or not the target rotations and translations in test_cases even returned results.

I'm not sure how the rotation matrices were flattened in the test_cases folder, I tried both setups and this one worked for more configurations so I went with it.

Here are the ones that didn't return any results:

RRC_fixed_q6:

rotation matrix: 
[[-0.91241883  0.39766253 -0.09672847]
 [ 0.01078113 -0.21291399 -0.97701146]
 [-0.40911569 -0.8924865   0.18997948]]
position vector: 
[0.274528149652083, 0.69131468964002, 0.0657458362625618]

two_parallel_bot:

rotation matrix: 
[[ 0.42145123  0.90035456 -0.10835371]

yumi_fixed_q3:

[[ 0.02531544 -0.9752333   0.21972516]
 [ 0.79802434 -0.11266525 -0.59199974]
 [ 0.60209325  0.19033276  0.77540774]] 
position vector: 
[0.266339682522742, 0.172417594903718, 0.68311822370677]

------------------
The other ones robots returned results on all of the tests in the test_cases folder, although the outputs rarely matched up with the expected q values.  
I assume this is because they were generated with different code, however, and I assume multiple different q vectors can lead to the same output.
